# invasion-pathogen-communities
The goal of this project is to evaluate the effects of plant origin on foliar fungal pathogen communities of native and introduced grasses in California, USA (Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve). 
Aim 1: Characterize the community structure and damage caused by foliar fungal pathogens for each plant origin group. 
Aim 2: Use plant density to evaluate the relative effects of native and introduced plants on foliar fungal damage and community structure.
